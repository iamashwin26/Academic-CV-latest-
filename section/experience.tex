\begin{itemize}
    \item Tried to find out the  superconducting transition of Yttrium barium copper oxide under the guidance of a PhD scholar.

 \item Raspberry Pi as a digital portable multimeter by using a resistor divider
  and current sensor.
 


  \item Built a computer  mouse  using an arduino and potentiometer based
   rotary encoder    \href {https://github.com/iamashwin26/Arduino-Projs/tree/master/Joystick_as_aMouse_Controller}{Source Code}.

 \item Built a novel stove stand which harnessed the otherwise  wasted heat energy 
 during cooking into electricity (about 20W). It also reduced the cooking time.

\textbf{Projects currently pursuing:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Project Kratos} \newline
    Design and build a rover to participate in University and European Rover Challenge for the year
2020. (Electronics team member.)
    \item \textbf{Team Imitato}\newline
    Using a hard exosuit to
control a humanoid that
can be beneficial in
reaching inaccessible
and non-human
conditions.(Electronics and Haptics control head)
    \item \textbf{Pressure sensitive mat}\newline
    To make a mat that can sense touch and the change in the touch to determine different poses such as Running, Jumping, Rightward-leftward movement,one leg hop etc.( working in electronics and algorithm design ) 
   \item \textbf{Digital pipette}\newline
   To create a low cost digital pipette that measures the liquid level using laser/ultrasonic proximity sensor.(working in the designing and electronics part)
